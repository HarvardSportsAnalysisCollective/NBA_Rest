# NBA_Rest

NBA teams and coaches have come under fire for resting their stars during the regular season, yet more and more coaches continue to do so. After all, [it is well known that teams perform worse in back-to-back games.](https://rotogrinders.com/lessons/nba-back-to-backs-209256) However, less research has been done to quantify how rest (or lack of rest) might impact individual players’ performances.

The goal of this project is to discover how rest might change the way individuals perform in both the regular season and the playoffs. Ideally, our analysis should be able to answer the following questions:
 - How can we expect a player’s performance to change, given that he had 1 day of rest, as opposed to 2 or 3 days of rest?
 - Are some players more heavily impacted by rest than others?
 - Does this affect change in the playoffs?
 - Is early-season rest just as impactful as more recent rest?

This project will require you to explore existing research on rest in the NBA, and think critically about:
 - How best to quantify a player’s rest
 - How to define and model a player’s “performance”
 - How to test the significance of rest in player performance
 - What confounding factors should be considered
 - How to visualize these results
 - What assumptions might be violated in our analysis

During the project, you will receive an introduction to R and/or Python. You will also learn basic data cleaning and data management skills, how to perform significance tests, how to perform regression, and how to contribute to a dynamic repository.
